-- CHECKOUT PAYMENT MISMATCH FIX SUMMARY
-- This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve payment mismatches in checkout

-- ISSUES FIXED:
-- 1. Enhanced checkout dialog was using total_amount instead of taxed_total_amount
-- 2. Remaining balance calculation was manual instead of using database outstanding_amount
-- 3. Advance amount calculation was inconsistent across components

-- COMPONENTS FIXED:
-- 1. components/enhanced-checkout-dialog.tsx
--    - Fixed calculatePriceAdjustment to use taxed_total_amount
--    - Fixed remaining balance to use database outstanding_amount
--    - Fixed payment summary to use database outstanding_amount

-- 2. components/checkout/enhanced-checkout-dialog.tsx
--    - Fixed advance amount calculation to use payment breakdown fields
--    - Fixed remaining balance calculation

-- 3. lib/supabase.ts (createChargePosting function)
--    - Fixed to include original room amount + charges in total
--    - Fixed to use booking_rooms.room_total for accurate calculations

-- DATABASE FIXES APPLIED:
-- 1. ultimate_fix_amount_discrepancy.sql - Fixed amount overrides
-- 2. comprehensive_room_charges_fix.sql - Fixed room + charges totals
-- 3. quick_fix_advance_payment_error.sql - Fixed advance payment errors

-- EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER ALL FIXES:
-- ✅ Total Booking shows: Room Amount + Charges
-- ✅ Outstanding shows: Correct database-calculated amount
-- ✅ Advance payments work without errors
-- ✅ Checkout calculations are consistent
-- ✅ All components use taxed_total_amount consistently
