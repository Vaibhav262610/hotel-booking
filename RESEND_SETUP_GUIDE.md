# Resend Email Setup Guide

## 🚨 **Current Issue: Resend Free Tier Limitations**

### **What's Happening:**

- ✅ Staff creation works perfectly
- ✅ Email templates are generated
- ❌ Email delivery fails due to Resend free tier restrictions

### **Resend Free Tier Limitations:**

1. **Can only send to verified email addresses** (your own email)
2. **Cannot send to any email address** without domain verification
3. **Limited to testing purposes** only

## 🔧 **Solution Options:**

### **Option 1: Test with Your Own Email (Quick Fix)**

1. **Use your own email address** when creating staff members
2. **Check your inbox** for the invitation email
3. **Verify the email content** and functionality

### **Option 2: Verify Your Domain (Production Ready)**

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**: [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. **Add your domain** (e.g., `yourhotel.com`)
3. **Add DNS records** as instructed by Resend
4. **Wait for verification** (usually 5-10 minutes)
5. **Update email service** to use your domain

### **Option 3: Use Alternative Email Service**

Switch to another email service that doesn't have these limitations:

#### **SendGrid (Recommended Alternative)**

```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

Update `lib/email-service.ts`:

```typescript
import sgMail from "@sendgrid/mail";
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY!);

// In sendEmail method:
await sgMail.send({
  to: emailData.to,
  from: "your-verified-sender@yourdomain.com",
  subject: emailData.subject,
  html: emailData.html,
  text: emailData.text,
});
```

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

## 🧪 **Testing Right Now:**

### **Step 1: Test with Your Email**

1. Go to staff management page
2. Create a new staff member
3. Use your email address (`developeralnoor@gmail.com`)
4. Check your inbox for the invitation email

### **Step 2: Check Console Logs**

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

```
📧 Resend free tier limitation: Can only send to verified email addresses
📧 Email would be sent to: your-email@example.com
📧 Subject: Welcome to Hotel Management System - Your Login Credentials
📧 Email content preview: <!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...
```

## 🎯 **Current System Status:**

### **⚠️ What Needs Setup:**

## 🚀 **Quick Test Instructions:**

1. **Create a staff member with your email:**
   - Name: Test Staff
   - Email: `developeralnoor@gmail.com` (your email)

   - Department: Front Office

2. **Check your email inbox** for the invitation

3. **Verify the email contains:**
   - Professional HTML design

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

## 📊 **Email Service Comparison for Your Use Case:**

| Service        | Free Tier    | Domain Required      | Setup Difficulty | Recommendation |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **Resend**     | 3,000/month  | Yes (for production) | Easy             | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |
| **SendGrid**   | 100/day      | No                   | Medium           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     |
| **AWS SES**    | 62,000/month | No                   | Hard             | ⭐⭐⭐         |
| **Nodemailer** | Free         | No                   | Medium           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |

## 🎯 **Recommendation:**

For immediate testing: **Use your own email address**

For production: **Switch to SendGrid** (easier setup, no domain verification needed for testing)

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test with your email** to verify the system works
2. **Choose an email service** for production
3. **Set up domain verification** if using Resend
4. **Deploy and test** with real staff members
