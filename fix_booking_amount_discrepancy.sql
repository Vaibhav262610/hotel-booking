-- Fix for booking creation amount discrepancy
-- The issue is that the database function is recalculating amounts differently than the frontend

-- The problem: Frontend calculates ₹6,672.00 but database shows ₹9,274.08
-- This suggests the database function is adding additional charges or using different tax rates

-- Solution: Update the recompute_booking_payment_breakdown function to use the frontend-calculated amount
-- when it's already correct, instead of recalculating
